## Population parameters
- **population mean**  
μ = (Σ * X)/ N 平均值
- **population variance** 
σ<sup>2</sup> is population variance 
$$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum^{i \to \1}_{n}{(x_i - \mu)^2}}{N}$$
- **population standard deviation**?

**z-score**? It represents the number of standard deviations away from the mean that a value is.
Reject H<sub>0</sub> when you have a relatively large |Z<sub>calc</sub>|; that is |Z<sub>calc</sub>| > |Z<sub>critical</sub>|.
In this situation, you reject h<sub>0</sub> when the value is a relatively large number of standard deviations away from the hypothesized value.
频率
central limited therom?

**P-Value**?

Z值越大，P值越小。

|Z<sub>calc</sub>| > |Z<sub>critical</sub>| ⇒ p-value < α ⇒ reject H<sub>0</sub>  ⇒accept H<sub>a</sub>

|Z<sub>calc</sub>| <= |Z<sub>critical</sub>| ⇒ p-value ≥ α ⇒ fail to reject H<sub>0</sub> 
​	 
​**RSquare** (0~1)

**correlation**: square root of rsquare

**Chi-square** test independence

**Fundamental Concepts**
- Always take a **random** and **representative** sample
- Remember that statistics is not an exact science
- Understand a Z-Score
- Understand the central limit theorem?
- Understand one-sample hypothesis testing
- Understand that few approaches/techniques are

**Data Mining**
- Formulate the problem
- Accumulate data
- Transform and select data
- Train models
- Evaluate models
- Deploy models
- Monitor results
